*****

How to setup:
In order to run the program we will be needing a few libraries, modules and dependencies.

First, Create a folder called "venv" and install the following modules:

OpenCV - pip install opencv-python

Pillow - pip install pillow

NumPy - pip install numpy

TKinter - pip install tk

*****

"venv" folder should look like this:
![venv folder](ref_images/image2.png "Venv Folder Contents")

Now, inside the "models" folder there should be three files:<br>
[1.] colorization_deploy_v2.prototxt<br>
[2.] pts_in_hull.npy<br>
[3.] colorization_release_v2.caffemodel<br>

"colorization_release_v2.caffemodel" file is not included because of large file size, we need to download, it can be found [here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FaDajjtAsntF_Sw5gqF0WyakviA5l8-a)<br>
P.S. I don't have these files on my drive, credits to the file hoster.

After having all the files the "models" folder should look like this:
![models folder](ref_images/image1.png "3 Models Files")

 The root folder should look like this:
![root folder](ref_images/image3.png "Root Folder with all Files")
